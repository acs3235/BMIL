# Discrete Hankel Transform

##Matlab code Code for the Discrete Hankel Transform

Previous definitions of a Discrete Hankel Transform (DHT) have focused on methods to approximate the continuous Hankel integral transform without regard for the properties of the DHT itself.  Recently, the theory of a Discrete Hankel Transform was proposed that follows the same path as the Discrete Fourier/Continuous Fourier transform.  This DHT possesses orthogonality properties which lead to invertibility and also possesses the standard set of discrete shift, modulation, multiplication and convolution rules.  The proposed DHT can be used to approximate the continuous forward and inverse Hankel transform.
